## ðŸŽ› - Self-Hosting (Requires node.js v14 or higher)

In order to self-host, you need to read the LICENSE file, but if you're too lazy, it basically says:

Credit me in order to use this project, or else, it'll be taken down :)

Follow the steps below:

### Step 1 - Download this code or clone the repo

You can download the code with the "Code" button. Save as zip.

#### OR

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vctrsm/Baguette.git
```

### Step 2 - Open a command prompt IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY, NOT IN ./src

Open a command prompt in the root directory. Simple.

### Step 3 - Install dependencies

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Step 4 - Rename example.config.json to config.json

You'll need:

Your bot's token from Discord dev portal

A MongoDB connection URI

The config file looks like this:

```sh
{
  "token": "Super Secret Token Here",
  "mongoUri": "Mongo Connection URI Here"
}

```
Fill in the details respectively.

## Step 5 - Ways to run the bot

If you just want to run the project as-is, open a command prompt and run this command:

```sh
npm start
```
If you're constantly making changes to the code, run the bot with:

```sh
npm run dev
```
