## üéõ - Self-Hosting (Requires node.js v14 or higher)

In order to self-host, you need to read the LICENSE file, but if you're too lazy, it basically says:

Credit me in order to use this project, or else, it'll be taken down :)

Follow the steps below:

### Step 1 - Download this code or clone the repo

You can download the code with the "Code" button. Save as zip.

#### OR

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vctrsm/Baguette.git
```

### Step 2 - Open a command prompt IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY, NOT IN ./src

Open a command prompt in the root directory. Simple.

### Step 3 - Install dependencies

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install
```
If you get any errors, run your command prompt as administrator.

### Step 4 - Rename example.config.json to config.json

You'll need:

Your bot's token from Discord dev portal
A MongoDB connection URI

The config file looks like this:

```sh
{
  "token": "Super Secret Token Here",
  "mongoUri": "Mongo Connection URI Here"
}

```
Fill in the details respectively.

## Step 5 - Ways to run the bot

If you just want to run the project as-is, open a command prompt and run this command:

```sh
npm start
```
If you're constantly making changes to the code, run the bot with:

```sh
npm run dev
```
### NOTE: If this is your case, I recommend you to read the contribution guide, **it means a lot!**

## üíª - Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! Make sure to have git installed from here: https://git-scm.com/

Click the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button at the top right.

You‚Äôll now have your own copy of that repository in your github account.

Open a terminal/shell.

Type
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:username/Baguette
```
where username is your username.

You‚Äôll now have a local copy of your version of that repository.

Change into that project directory (Baguette):
```sh
$ cd Baguette-master
```
Add a connection to my repository.

```sh
$ git remote add vctrsm git://github.com/vctrsm/Baguette
```
Note the distinction between git@github.com: in the first case and git://github.com/ in the second case. The former is for the case that you have write access to the repository, whereas the latter is what to do when you only want read access.
```sh
$ git remote add repo_nickname git://github.com/vctrsm/Baguette
```
To check this remote add set up:
```sh
$ git remote -v
```
Make changes to files.
```sh
git add 
```
and 
```sh
git commit
```
those changes
```sh
git push 
```
them back to github. These will go to your version of the repository.

Note: if you get an error like:
```sh
error: src refspec master does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:username/the_repo'
```
Then try
```sh
git push origin HEAD:gh-pages 
```

Typing
```sh
git show-ref
```
can show what reference to put after HEAD.

Go to your version of the repository on github.

Click the ‚ÄúPull Request‚Äù button at the top.

Note that myepository will be on the left and your repository will be on the right.

Click the green button ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù. Give a succinct and informative title, in the comment field give a short explanation of the changes and click the green button ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù again.

Pulling others‚Äô changes
Before you make further changes to the repository, you should check that your version is up to date relative to your friend‚Äôs version.

Go into the directory for the project and type:
```sh
$ git pull Baguette master
```

This will pull down and merge all of the changes that I have made.

Now push them back to your github repository.
```sh
$ git push
```
If you followed all of these steps, congratulations! You have contributed on making Baguette better!
